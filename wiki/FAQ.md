- Web server (Apache/Nginx) with mod_rewrite
- At least 1GB RAM and 10GB storage

### Q: How long does installation take?

- File permissions setup
- First partner configuration
- Testing and verification

### Q: Can I run this on shared hosting?
**A:** Yes, if your shared hosting supports:
- PHP 7.4+ with required extensions

## üìä Configuration & Setup

### Q: How do I get a Telegram bot token?
**A:** Follow these steps:
1. Message @BotFather on Telegram
2. Send `/newbot` command
3. Choose a name and username for your bot
4. Copy the provided token (format: `123456789:ABCdef...`)
5. Add your bot to your channel as an administrator

### Q: What's the difference between ClickID keys and Sum keys?
**A:**
- **ClickID Keys**: Parameter names that contain the unique click identifier (e.g., `clickid`, `cid`, `click_id`)
- **Sum Keys**: Parameter names that contain the conversion value/payout (e.g., `sum`, `payout`, `revenue`)

The system will search for these parameters in the postback URL.

### Q: How does sum mapping work?
**A:** Sum mapping transforms the original conversion value to a different amount:
- Original sum `100` ‚Üí Mapped sum `80` (20% commission)
- Original sum `50` ‚Üí Mapped sum `40` (20% commission)
- Used for taking commissions, currency conversion, or different payout rates

### Q: Can I have multiple partners with the same target domain?
**A:** Yes, multiple partners can redirect to the same target domain. Each partner has a unique ID and can have different:
- Parameter configurations
- Sum mapping rules
- Integration settings
- Access restrictions

## üîß Technical Questions

### Q: How do I create a postback URL?
**A:** The postback URL format is:
```
https://yourdomain.com/track/postback.php?pid=PARTNER_ID&clickid={click_id}&sum={payout}
```
Replace `PARTNER_ID` with your actual partner ID, and `{click_id}`, `{payout}` with your affiliate network's macros.

### Q: What happens if the target domain is down?
**A:** The system will:
1. Attempt to contact the target domain
2. Log the error if it fails
3. Return an appropriate HTTP status code
4. Store the attempt in statistics with error details
5. Continue processing other requests normally

### Q: How often does the queue processor run?
**A:** By default, every 5 minutes via cron job:
```bash
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/track/process_queue.php
```
You can adjust this to every minute for near real-time processing.

### Q: What's the maximum number of partners I can have?
**A:** There's no hard limit. The system can handle hundreds of partners. Performance depends on:
- Server resources
- Database optimization
- Traffic volume per partner
- Background processing configuration

## üìà Statistics & Monitoring

### Q: How long is statistical data kept?
**A:** By default, data is kept indefinitely. You can implement data retention by:
- Setting up automated cleanup scripts
- Partitioning tables by date
- Archiving old data to separate tables
- Using the "Clear Stats" feature for specific partners

### Q: What does "Sum Count" vs "Map Count" mean?
**A:**
- **Sum Count**: Conversions that included a sum/payout value
- **Map Count**: Conversions where sum mapping was applied
- **Difference**: Conversions with sums but no mapping rules

### Q: Can I export statistics data?
**A:** Yes, several options:
- Google Sheets integration for automatic export
- Direct database queries
- API endpoints for custom integrations
- Manual CSV export from the admin interface

### Q: How do I search for specific conversions?
**A:** Use the smart search in partner statistics:
- `clickid:abc123` - Find specific click ID
- `param:utm_source` - Find conversions with specific parameters
- `url:google` - Find URLs containing "google"
- `EMPTY` - Find records with missing data
- `status:200` - Find successful conversions

3. Enable "IP filtering"
4. Add allowed IP addresses

### Q: How do I protect the admin interface?
**A:** Several methods:
- Use strong passwords

- Your profit: $100 - $80 = $20

### Q: Can I track multiple conversion types?
**A:** Yes, use different approaches:
- **Multiple Partners**: Different partner IDs for different conversion types
- **URL Parameters**: Use custom parameters to distinguish types
- **Sum Mapping**: Different mapping rules for different values
- **Target Domains**: Route different types to different endpoints

### Q: Is there a limit on conversion volume?
**A:** No built-in limits. System performance depends on:
- Server specifications
- Database optimization
- Network connectivity
