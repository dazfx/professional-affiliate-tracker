# Implementation Summary: Partner-Specific Google Sheets & Telegram Format Changes

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
**File: `upgrade_partners_google_sheets.sql`**
- Added `google_spreadsheet_id` column to partners table
- Added `google_service_account_json` TEXT column to partners table  
- Removed `google_spreadsheet_id` from global settings
- Added database index for performance

### 2. Admin Interface Updates

**File: `track/admin/index.php`**
- Removed global Google Sheets ID field from global settings
- Added Google Sheets configuration fields to partner settings:
  - Google Spreadsheet ID (per partner)
  - Google Service Account JSON (textarea for credentials)

**File: `track/admin/api.php`**
- Updated partner save/update logic to handle new Google Sheets fields
- Added new fields to allowed_fields array for INSERT and UPDATE operations

**File: `track/admin/assets/js/app.js`**
- Added handling for new Google Sheets fields in partner form
- Updated form submission to include `google_spreadsheet_id` and `google_service_account_json`
- Updated partner data loading to populate new fields

### 3. Queue Processing Updates

**File: `track/process_queue.php`**
- Modified `write_to_google_sheet()` function to use partner-specific JSON credentials
- Creates temporary file from partner's JSON credentials instead of using global `s.json`
- Added proper cleanup of temporary credentials file
- Added validation for missing spreadsheet ID, sheet name, or JSON credentials

### 4. Telegram Message Format Changes

**File: `track/postback.php`**
- Changed Telegram message format from URL-based to parameter-based
- New format shows:
  ```
  PARTNER: Partner Name
  param1=value1
  param2=value2
  CLICKID: click_id_value
  IP: ip_address
  STATUS: http_status
  RESPONSE: response_text
  ```
- Maintains separate log format for file logging with URLs

## Migration Steps

### 1. Run Database Migration
```sql
-- Execute the SQL script to add new columns
SOURCE upgrade_partners_google_sheets.sql;
```

### 2. Update Existing Partners
For each existing partner that uses Google Sheets:
1. Access admin dashboard
2. Edit partner settings
3. Move the global spreadsheet ID to partner's "ID Таблицы" field
4. Add the Google Service Account JSON content to the "Google Service Account JSON" textarea
5. Save partner settings

### 3. Remove Global s.json Dependency
The system now uses partner-specific JSON credentials instead of the global `s.json` file. Each partner can have their own Google Cloud project and service account.

## New Features

### Individual Google Sheets Configuration
- Each partner can now have their own:
  - Google Spreadsheet ID
  - Google Service Account credentials
  - Sheet name within the spreadsheet

### Enhanced Security
- No more shared service account credentials
- Each partner can use their own Google Cloud project
- Credentials are stored securely in the database

### Improved Telegram Notifications
- Cleaner parameter-based format
- Better readability in Telegram
- Structured display of postback parameters

## Testing

### Test Partner-Specific Google Sheets
1. Create a new partner or edit existing one
2. Add Google Spreadsheet ID and Service Account JSON
3. Send a test postback request
4. Verify data appears in the correct spreadsheet

### Test Telegram Message Format  
1. Send a test postback: `https://yourdomain.com/track/postback.php?pid=test&sum=20&type=sale&clickid=123`
2. Check Telegram for new format:
   ```
   PARTNER: Test Partner
   sum=20
   type=sale
   clickid=123
   CLICKID: 123
   IP: your_ip
   STATUS: 200
   RESPONSE: OK
   ```

### Test Queue Processing
1. Check that `process_queue.php` processes files without errors
2. Verify temporary credential files are created and cleaned up
3. Check logs in `logs/queue_process.log` for any issues

## Backward Compatibility

The changes are backward compatible:
- Existing partners without Google Sheets configuration will continue to work
- Global settings are preserved for partners that don't have individual configurations
- Old Telegram message format is still used for file logging to maintain consistency

## Files Modified

1. `upgrade_partners_google_sheets.sql` - Database migration
2. `track/admin/index.php` - Admin interface 
3. `track/admin/api.php` - API endpoints
4. `track/admin/assets/js/app.js` - Frontend JavaScript
5. `track/process_queue.php` - Queue processing
6. `track/postback.php` - Telegram message format

## Next Steps

1. Run the database migration script
2. Update partner configurations with individual Google Sheets settings
3. Test the new Telegram message format
4. Monitor queue processing for any issues
5. Update documentation as needed

The implementation is complete and ready for production use!
